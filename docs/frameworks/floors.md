## Overview

The Gauntlet is divided into **floors**. Each floor contains exactly **3 markers**
(bankroll targets the player must hit to progress). The third marker on every
floor is always a **Boss fight** with a special rule modifier.

```
Gauntlet (12 markers total)
├── Floor 1: The Loading Dock  [marker 0] [marker 1] [marker 2 — BOSS: The Foreman]
├── Floor 2: VFW Hall          [marker 3] [marker 4] [marker 5 — BOSS: Sarge]
├── Floor 3: The Riverboat     [marker 6] [marker 7] [marker 8 — BOSS: Mme. Le Prix]
└── Floor 4: The Strip         [marker 9] [marker 10] [marker 11 — BOSS: The Executive]
```

Clearing a marker sends the player to the **Seven-Proof Pub** to recruit a crew
member. Clearing a boss marker additionally awards a permanent **comp perk**.
Clearing all 3 markers on a floor triggers a **Floor Reveal** cinematic before
the player proceeds to the next floor.

---

## Architecture

Floor content is split across three systems that must stay in sync:

| System | File | Contains | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Narrative** | `packages/shared/src/floors.ts` | Names, taglines, intro text, boss teasers, atmosphere | Design |
| **Mechanical** | `packages/shared/src/config.ts` | Marker targets, boss rules, comp rewards, bet limits | Engineering |
| **Visual** | `apps/web/src/lib/floorThemes.ts` | CSS tokens, colors, gradients, felt textures | Design/Engineering |
| **Contract** | `docs/floors.md` ← **you are here** | The human-readable specification | Design |

All three systems link by **floor id** (1-indexed integer) and **marker index**
(0-based, 0–8 for the MVP gauntlet).

```
markerIndex → floorId:   Math.floor(markerIndex / 3) + 1
floorId → markerIndices: [(id-1)*3, (id-1)*3 + 1, (id-1)*3 + 2]
```

---

## FloorConfig Schema

Defined in `packages/shared/src/floors.ts`. Exported from `@battlecraps/shared`.

```typescript
interface FloorConfig {
  id:          number;          // 1-indexed. Floor 1 = markers 0–2.
  name:        string;          // Short venue name. ~2–3 words.
  tagline:     string;          // One atmospheric line. Max ~8 words.
  introLines:  string[];        // 2–3 sentences for floor reveal cinematic.
  bossName:    string;          // Must match BossConfig.name in config.ts.
  bossTitle:   string;          // Boss's role in the venue. ~4–6 words.
  bossVenue:   string;          // Must match boss marker's venue in config.ts.
  bossTeaser:  string;          // One ominous line hinting at the boss rule.
  atmosphere:  FloorAtmosphere; // 'gritty' | 'elegant' | 'electric'
}
```

### Field guidance

**`name`** — The venue the player is in for non-boss markers. Should feel like a
real place with character. Not the High Limit Room name (that's `bossVenue`).

**`tagline`** — Shown beneath the floor name on the reveal screen. Should capture
the essence of the venue in a single phrase. Rhythm matters — read it aloud.

**`introLines`** — Displayed during the floor reveal cinematic. Each string is a
paragraph. Aim for: sensory detail (line 1) → the boss's presence (line 2) →
the threat to the player (line 3). Do not name the boss's rule explicitly.

**`bossName`** — Must be an exact string match to `BossConfig.name` on the
corresponding marker in `config.ts`. Case-sensitive. Used in floor reveal
teasers and boss headers.

**`bossTeaser`** — The last thing the player reads before the floor reveal fades
to the boss entry modal. Should feel like a warning, not a spoiler. Reference
the rule's effect obliquely, not mechanically.

**`atmosphere`** — Controls the ambient animation palette:
- `'gritty'`   → worn warmth, slow breathing pulse
- `'elegant'`  → cool restraint, subtle shimmer
- `'electric'` → high contrast, fast pulse, neon strobe on hot streaks

---

## FloorTheme Schema

Defined in `apps/web/src/lib/floorThemes.ts`. Not exported from shared — web only.

```typescript
interface FloorTheme {
  // Table surface
  feltPrimary: string;      // Main felt hex color
  feltRail:    string;      // Crew rail background hex
  feltTexture: string;      // CSS background-image (SVG data URI)

  // Accent colors
  accentBright:  string;    // Full-brightness accent (headings, CTA glow)
  accentPrimary: string;    // Standard accent (borders, labels)
  accentDim:     string;    // Dimmed accent (dividers, inactive)

  // Borders (pre-computed RGBA)
  borderHigh: string;       // ~30% opacity — outer containers
  borderLow:  string;       // ~20% opacity — internal dividers

  // Breathing overlay (CSS rgba strings)
  breatheCold: string;      // streak < 1 AND hype < 1.2
  breatheWarm: string;      // streak >= 1 OR hype >= 1.2
  breatheHot:  string;      // streak >= 3 OR hype >= 2.0

  // Screen flash (CSS rgba strings)
  flashWin:  string;        // NATURAL / POINT_HIT
  flashLose: string;        // SEVEN_OUT / CRAPS_OUT

  // Pub / Recruitment screen
  pubName:         string;  // Display name shown in the pub header
  pubBg:           string;  // radial-gradient for container background
  pubAccentBar:    string;  // linear-gradient for top/bottom accent bars
  pubOverlayBg:    string;  // radial-gradient for atmosphere overlay
  pubTitleColor:   string;  // CSS color for pub h1
  pubTitleShadow:  string;  // CSS text-shadow for pub h1
  pubSubtextColor: string;  // CSS color for secondary pub text

  // Boss entry modal
  bossBg:          string;  // radial-gradient for boss modal background
  bossAccentBar:   string;  // linear-gradient for boss accent bars
  bossGlow:        string;  // radial-gradient for ambient glow overlay
  bossTextColor:   string;  // CSS color for boss h1 and key text
  bossTitleShadow: string;  // CSS text-shadow for boss h1
  bossBorderColor: string;  // RGBA for boss room borders
  bossStarColor:   string;  // CSS color for ★ badge foreground
  bossStarBg:      string;  // CSS background for ★ badge
  bossStarBorder:  string;  // CSS border for ★ badge
  bossStarGlow:    string;  // CSS box-shadow for ★ badge glow
}
```

### Theming guidance

Each floor should feel like a distinct world:

| Token group | Floor 1 (gritty) | Floor 2 (elegant) | Floor 3 (electric) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Felt | Worn green | Midnight navy | Near-black obsidian |
| Accent | Tarnished gold | Champagne brass | Electric gold |
| Breathing cold | Green haze | River indigo | City blue |
| Breathing hot | Ember orange | Crimson warning | Neon magenta strobe |
| Flash win | Warm gold | Champagne shimmer | Blinding white-gold |
| Flash lose | Dark red | Navy blackout | Neon magenta-red |
| Pub name | THE SEVEN-PROOF PUB | THE PROMENADE BAR | THE SKY LOUNGE |

---

## MarkerConfig & BossConfig Schema

Defined in `packages/shared/src/config.ts`. Exported from `@battlecraps/shared`.

```typescript
interface MarkerConfig {
  targetCents: number;    // Bankroll threshold to clear this marker, in cents
  venue:       string;    // Venue name for non-boss markers (matches FloorConfig.name)
  floor:       number;    // 1-indexed floor number
  isBoss:      boolean;   // True for every 3rd marker (indices 2, 5, 8)
  boss?:       BossConfig // Present only when isBoss === true
}

interface BossConfig {
  name:          string;          // Must match FloorConfig.bossName exactly
  rule:          BossRuleType;    // The mechanical modifier active during the fight
  compReward:    CompRewardType;  // Permanent perk awarded on defeat
  compPerkId:    number;          // Stable numeric ID written to users.comp_perk_ids
  flavorText:    string;          // Quote shown in boss entry modal (the boss speaking)
  risingMinBets? RisingMinBetsParams // Only for RISING_MIN_BETS rule
}
```

---

## Boss Rule Catalogue

All boss rules currently implemented. New rules require both a `BossRuleType`
entry in `config.ts` and server-side logic in `apps/api/src/routes/rolls.ts`.

### `RISING_MIN_BETS`
**Boss:** Sarge (Floor 1)
**Icon:** ⬆
**Effect:** The minimum Pass Line bet starts at `startPct` of the marker target
and increases by `incrementPct` after each Point Hit. The minimum HOLDS on
Seven Out (never drops). Caps at `capPct` of target.
**Parameters:**
```typescript
interface RisingMinBetsParams {
  startPct:     number; // Fraction of target on roll 1 (e.g. 0.05 = 5%)
  incrementPct: number; // Added per Point Hit (e.g. 0.02 = +2%)
  capPct:       number; // Never exceeds this fraction (e.g. 0.20 = 20%)
}
```
**Sarge values:** start 5% ($50 at $1,000 target) → +2% per hit → cap 20% ($200)

---

### `DISABLE_CREW`
**Boss:** Mme. Le Prix (Floor 2)
**Icon:** ↺
**Effect:** The crew cascade fires in **reverse order** (slot 4 → slot 0 instead
of 0 → 4). This can invert protective abilities that rely on earlier crew having
already fired. No additional parameters.

---

### `FOURS_INSTANT_LOSS`
**Boss:** The Executive (Floor 3)
**Icon:** ☠
**Effect:** Any roll totalling **4** (regardless of phase or point) immediately
triggers GAME_OVER for the entire run. The player loses all remaining shooters.
No additional parameters. The most severe rule — no recovery.

---

## How to Add a New Floor

When the gauntlet expands beyond 3 floors, follow this checklist in order.
Each step references which file to touch.

> **Before writing any code:** Fill out the floor definition in this document
> (§ Floor Definitions section) and get it reviewed. Code is the last step.

### Step 1 — Add to `docs/floors.md` (this file)
Copy the template below and fill in all fields. Get design sign-off.

```markdown
## Floor N — [Venue Name]

**Atmosphere:** gritty | elegant | electric | [new atmosphere]
**Tagline:** [one line]
**Intro lines:**
1. [sensory detail]
2. [boss presence hint]
3. [threat to player]

### Boss: [Boss Name]
**Title:** [role]
**Venue:** [High Limit Room name]
**Teaser:** [one ominous line]
**Rule:** [RULE_TYPE] — [one-sentence description]
**Comp reward:** [REWARD_TYPE] — [what it does]
**Flavor text (boss quote):** "[the boss speaking in first person]"

### Markers
| # | Target | Venue | Boss? |
|---|---|---|---|
| N*3   | $X,XXX | [name] | No |
| N*3+1 | $X,XXX | [name] | No |
| N*3+2 | $X,XXX | [High Limit Room] | Yes |
```

### Step 2 — Add `FloorConfig` to `packages/shared/src/floors.ts`
Append a new entry to the `FLOORS` array:
```typescript
{
  id:         N,
  name:       '[Venue Name]',
  tagline:    '[tagline]',
  introLines: ['[line 1]', '[line 2]', '[line 3]'],
  bossName:   '[Boss Name]',      // must match Step 3
  bossTitle:  '[Boss Title]',
  bossVenue:  '[High Limit Room Name]',
  bossTeaser: '[teaser]',
  atmosphere: 'gritty' | 'elegant' | 'electric',
},
```

### Step 3 — Add markers to `packages/shared/src/config.ts`
Append 3 entries to the `GAUNTLET` array:
```typescript
{ targetCents: X_XXX_00, venue: '[Venue Name]',           floor: N, isBoss: false },
{ targetCents: X_XXX_00, venue: '[Venue Name]',           floor: N, isBoss: false },
{ targetCents: X_XXX_00, venue: '[High Limit Room Name]', floor: N, isBoss: true,
  boss: {
    name:       '[Boss Name]',   // must match Step 2
    rule:       '[RULE_TYPE]',
    compReward: '[REWARD_TYPE]',
    compPerkId: COMP_PERK_IDS.[NEW_ID],
    flavorText: '[boss quote]',
  }
},
```
Also add the new `compPerkId` to the `COMP_PERK_IDS` const.

### Step 4 — Add `FloorTheme` to `apps/web/src/lib/floorThemes.ts`
Create `FLOOR_N_THEME: FloorTheme = { ... }` and append it to the `THEMES` array.
Consult the theming guidance table above. Every CSS token must be provided.

### Step 5 — Implement new boss rule (if rule type is new)
- Add `'NEW_RULE_TYPE'` to `BossRuleType` in `config.ts`
- Implement rule logic in `apps/api/src/routes/rolls.ts`
- Implement rule display in `apps/web/src/components/BossRoomHeader.tsx`
- See [How to Add a New Boss Rule](#how-to-add-a-new-boss-rule) below

### Step 6 — Done
No changes to transition components, App.tsx, TransitionOrchestrator, or
TRANSITION_REGISTRY are needed. All phase components (FloorRevealPhase,
BossEntryPhase, BossVictoryPhase, etc.) read from the config at runtime.

---

## How to Add a New Boss Rule

### Step 1 — Add to `BossRuleType` in `config.ts`
```typescript
export type BossRuleType =
  | 'RISING_MIN_BETS'
  | 'DISABLE_CREW'
  | 'FOURS_INSTANT_LOSS'
  | 'YOUR_NEW_RULE';  // add here
```

### Step 2 — Add rule parameters interface (if needed)
If your rule has tunable parameters (like `RisingMinBetsParams`), add an
interface to `config.ts` and a field to `BossConfig`:
```typescript
export interface YourRuleParams { ... }

export interface BossConfig {
  ...
  yourRuleParams?: YourRuleParams;
}
```

### Step 3 — Implement in `apps/api/src/routes/rolls.ts`
The server enforces all boss rules during roll resolution. Find the block
that checks the current boss rule and add your case. Rules should be
applied in `resolveRoll()` or `resolveCascade()` depending on when they fire.

### Step 4 — Add to `BossRoomHeader.tsx`
The boss room header shows the active rule and its current state. Add a
display branch for your rule type. Follow the existing pattern.

### Step 5 — Document in this file (§ Boss Rule Catalogue)
Add an entry to the Boss Rule Catalogue section with: boss name, icon
suggestion, effect description, parameters (if any).

## Floor 1 — The Loading Dock

**Atmosphere:** `exposed`
**Tagline:** The street. The hustle. Where it all begins.
**Intro lines:**
1. Stained concrete and the harsh glare of a sodium-vapor streetlamp. The air is cold, and the dice are chipped.
2. The Foreman stands by the freight elevator, steel-toed and impatient. He decides who gets to step inside.
3. The street always takes its cut. Don't bleed out before the real game even starts.

### Markers

| Index | Target | Venue | Boss? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | $50 | The Loading Dock | No |
| 1 | $100 | The Loading Dock | No |
| 2 | $250 | The Loading Dock — Freight Elevator | **Yes** |

### Boss: The Foreman

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Title** | Loading Dock Gatekeeper |
| **Venue** | The Loading Dock — Freight Elevator |
| **Teaser** | The Foreman doesn't care if you win or lose. He just wants his cut. |
| **Rule** | `EXTORTION_FEE` |
| **Comp reward** | `THE_VIG` — You took over the corner. Any crew abilities that award direct cash are permanently increased by 20%. |
| **Comp perk ID** | 4 |

**Rule effect:** A flat 20% tax is automatically deducted from all winning payouts across all bets. The math rounds down to the nearest cent. This severely impacts bankroll acceleration and forces the player to rely more on crew abilities to build momentum.

**Flavor text:** *"You're blocking my dock. Clear out or pay up."*

**Visual theme tokens:**
- Felt: `#1c1d21` (stained concrete)
- Accent: `#ff9900` (sodium-vapor orange)
- Boss tint: `#eab308` (industrial hazard yellow)
- Pub name: THE MILK CRATE CIRCLE

---

## Floor 2 — VFW Hall

**Atmosphere:** `gritty`
**Tagline:** Where dice meet duty.
**Intro lines:**
1. Cigarette smoke and fluorescent hum. Folding tables, chipped chips, honest action.
2. The regulars know your face. The Sarge runs a tight room.
3. This is where runs are born — or buried.

### Markers

| Index | Target | Venue | Boss? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | $300 | VFW Hall | No |
| 4 | $600 | VFW Hall | No |
| 5 | $1,000 | VFW Hall — High Limit Room | **Yes** |

### Boss: Sarge

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Title** | Floor Commander |
| **Venue** | VFW Hall — High Limit Room |
| **Teaser** | Sarge sets the floor. And the floor keeps rising. |
| **Rule** | `RISING_MIN_BETS` |
| **Comp reward** | `EXTRA_SHOOTER` — Member's Jacket: +1 Shooter this segment |
| **Comp perk ID** | 1 |

**Rule parameters:**
- Start: 5% of $1,000 target = **$50 minimum** on first roll
- Increment: +2% per Point Hit = **+$20 per hit**
- Cap: 20% of target = **$200 maximum**
- Hold: minimum **holds on Seven Out**, never drops

**Flavor text:** *"You want to play in MY hall? Ante up, soldier."*

**Visual theme tokens:**
- Felt: `#1a4731` (worn green)
- Accent: `#f5c842` (tarnished gold)
- Boss tint: `#dc2626` (military red)
- Pub name: THE SEVEN-PROOF PUB

---

## Floor 3 — The Riverboat

**Atmosphere:** `elegant`
**Tagline:** Fortune flows with the current.
**Intro lines:**
1. Mahogany panels. Candlelight. The paddle wheel churns the dark water below.
2. Mme. Le Prix does not raise her voice. She doesn't need to.
3. Your crew works differently here. Adapt, or sink.

### Markers

| Index | Target | Venue | Boss? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | $1,500 | The Riverboat | No |
| 7 | $2,500 | The Riverboat | No |
| 8 | $4,000 | The Riverboat — Salon Privé | **Yes** |

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Title** | Proprietress of the Salon Privé |
| **Venue** | The Riverboat — Salon Privé |
| **Teaser** | Mme. Le Prix reverses the order of things. Everything costs more than you think. |
| **Rule** | `DISABLE_CREW` |
| **Comp reward** | `HYPE_RESET_HALF` — Sea Legs: Hype resets to 50% on Seven Out (not 1.0×) |
| **Comp perk ID** | 2 |

**Rule effect:** Crew cascade fires right-to-left (slot 4 → 0) instead of
left-to-right. Abilities that depend on earlier crew having already modified the
context may misfire or have reduced effect.

**Flavor text:** *"On my table, the crew works backwards. Adapt."*

**Visual theme tokens:**
- Felt: `#0a1832` (midnight navy)
- Accent: `#c9a96e` (champagne brass)
- Boss tint: `#c9a96e` / crimson `#9b2335`
- Pub name: THE PROMENADE BAR

---

## Floor 4 — The Strip

**Atmosphere:** `electric`
**Tagline:** Sixty floors up. No safety net.
**Intro lines:**
1. Obsidian felt. Floor-to-ceiling glass. The city grid glitters sixty stories below.
2. The Executive doesn't cheat. He doesn't need to.
3. One number ends it all. Don't roll it.

### Markers

|---|---|---|---|
| 9 | $6,000 | The Strip | No |
| 10 | $9,000 | The Strip | No |

### Boss: The Executive

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Title** | Penthouse Host |
| **Venue** | The Strip — Penthouse |
| **Teaser** | The Executive has one rule. It's the only one that matters. |
| **Rule** | `FOURS_INSTANT_LOSS` |
| **Comp reward** | `GOLDEN_TOUCH` — Guaranteed Natural on first come-out roll of next segment |
| **Comp perk ID** | 3 |

**Rule effect:** Any roll totalling 4 triggers immediate GAME_OVER for the entire
run. No exceptions. Applies in both COME_OUT and POINT_ACTIVE phases.

**Flavor text:** *"Fours are for losers. Don't roll one."*

**Visual theme tokens:**
- Felt: `#05020f` (near-black obsidian)
- Accent: `#ffd700` (electric gold)
- Boss tint: `#ffd700` / violet undertone
- Pub name: THE SKY LOUNGE
